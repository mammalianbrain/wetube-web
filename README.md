WeTube</h1>
<h1 class="title"><a id='magicparlabel-482' />
the new revolutionary p2p media provider</h1>

<div class="abstract"><div class="abstract_label">Abstract</div>
<div class="abstract_item"><a id='magicparlabel-483' />
WeTube comes in a time in which we are seing enourmus efforts from the people to overcome the problems of censorship and central information control over all Internet. Notorius are the examples of YouTube, Vimeo, and other regulated places. YouTube itself, for example, is directly censored in many countries (<span class="flex_url">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Censorship</span>), impiding people to access to the biggest media database avaiable today for humans, and therefore making a precius source of information not avaiable for human evolution and free interchange of information.</div>
<div class="abstract_item"><a id='magicparlabel-488' />
But not only censorships ocur to websites, but also the websites themselves are obliged to censor many of the contents that the users upload, many times to adjust to arbitrarian regulations that are imposed by a few, only serve a few, and restrict the majority.</div>
<div class="abstract_item"><a id='magicparlabel-489' />
We belive this is a serius problem, and we should overcome it by the means we can for the moment: technology.</div>
<div class="abstract_item"><a id='magicparlabel-490' />
We are happy to present here a good solution, and we expect that the technology expressed in this document can make you excited enough to understand the big implications that this is going to achieve very soon.</div>
<div class="abstract_item"><a id='magicparlabel-491' />
We exorte you to join us. We truly need you, as this is a movement from humans to humans. Please read on.</div>
</div>
<h2 class="section_"><a id='magicparlabel-492' />
The three pillars of WeTube: freedom, privacy, voluntary moderation</h2>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-493' />
Imagine a web page where you can upload any video, music, image or document, and it will be inmediatly avaiable to everybody without restrictions, without anybody knowing who you are (if you want), without anybody censoring you.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-494' />
Imagine a web page where you can access any media you want without anybody having to know what are you doing, not being imposed to authenticate with your real ID, IP, or associated credit card number, not being observed by the big brother, and at the same time the content you access is of high quality and helpful for your evolution and relationships.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-495' />
Imagine you are a publisher, a periodist or an editor, and there is a place where you can safetly publish your discoverings, but without any censorship at all, while at the same time you are able to get rid of the junk and noise around you, providing only good quality researches and associations with you audence.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-496' />
Imagine you are an artist that lives for and from your art, and you have a free place where you can express your ideas and concepts, participate in comunity with your followers and other artists, and even earn the money you deserve for your hard work, without imposing others and not having to pay big comissions to any private editor or distributor, nor having to support their greed and censorships.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-551' />
Imagine a media where you can get rid of the junk so easy as doing a click. Imagine being your own moderator, where you can select what is good and bad for yourself and your family, without having to surrender yourself to what other has decided, specially when that other is trying to impose you a vision you don't agree with.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-602' />
Imagine a place where you can choose multiple moderators, including yourself or no moderators at all, being them people and organizations you really trust, and the posibility to add or remove them without restriction. Imagine how good a free moderator could be if their motivation is to serve only what people want while removing what they don't, not what a big guy on top of him/her decides. Moderators with big impositions and bad appliance of filters would be rapidly abandoned by the comunity, and their reputation disminished.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-758' />
Imagine that the media you see is temporaly stored on your computer so you can see it multiple times without having to reload it. Imagine that the content you like most is permanently stored on your computer so if you lost your internet connection you can still access it. Imagine a safeguard of all the important media you have in case of media server shutdowns, human crisis, war, or goverment censorship. You don't have that in today's standard media providers, as they prohibit you to store the content. Even companies like Google prohibits the publishing of browsers add-ons that use a trick to record the media, making YouTube videos very difficult to get stored locally with the Chrome browser.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1132' />
Imagine that you are a legit enterpreneur and have a useful and good business that you need to promote. The audence of this new media provider will be large and a real oportunity for you to come in. Every single area of business you can think of is covered, and you'll be able to perfectly select the categories you want to be in. Even better is the fact that advertisers can select to what moderation they want to be attached, so you can perfectly choose moderators who provide legal only content in your country.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-995' />
Imagine that you are a programmer and/or a system administrator and you want your deserved reward for your hard work while being useful to humanity. You can host a server and earn bitcoins proportional to the amount of bandwith, space and maintence you serve. At the same time, the protocol is specially designed to protect you against the arbitrarian laws, as you can select which moderators you're going to serve, and therefore, the content your server helps the user to download. But not even that, most of the contents are actually not stored in your servers, but interchanged between users alone, making this protocol a really distributed anonymous one. We even optionally protect your IP with a technology similar to hidden Tor services if you want to serve delicate searches, at only the cost of some added latency. You are a crucial part of this revolution.</div>
<h2 class="section_"><a id='magicparlabel-1499' />
Is this another moderated system?</h2>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1505' />
Yes and no. It is moderated in the sense that oneself can be the moderator, or relay the task to a trusted moderator or a group of moderators. The magic of this system is that it allows full freedom, while maintaing the convenience of good-quality results and potential legality, as explained bellow.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1539' />
First things first. In WeTube, there is a root moderator called &ldquo;unmoderator&rdquo; which acepts everything and cannot be violated in any form. This moderator resides in no place and all its content is purely in the cloud of users. Not a single part of this moderator content and searches resides in any server, except if the server administrator decides so, which s/he must explicitly configure to. This moderator fullfils freedom and zero discrimination, which unfortunately includes low quality results and potentially some illegal content in some countries.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1680' />
You can compare this unmoderator with raw eMule, Tor hidden services, Gnutella, Kademlia, and other p2p protocols offering searches and/or magnet links. One who has used those programs knows that the results are more often than not of very low quality, when not ilegit or honeypots. But yet, people use those programs because of censorships and copyright issues in their countries, so they accept the junk in favor to obtain some valuable content.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1768' />
That drives us to a problem: because no moderation is taken place, both the quality and legality of the content is disminished, and most people don't use them because of that.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1815' />
So, what to do? We dont want to be illegal, and at the same time we want full access to quality content which is censored in central mainstream medias. We also want privacy, one thing wich we don't have today unless we use very complicated technology.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1839' />
The point here is: you can't have legallity and good quality content in an unmoderated system. After a while, the system will be full of junk and legally dungerous staff.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1877' />
So we introduce moderators. But let the thing be WELL done. We choose to be OUR OWN moderators. Certainly not a good thing for opressive business and goverments, who want to be the only one moderators (we should call them opressive censorers, or just fascists), but still a good thing for goverments and enterpreneus who embrace freedom and really take care of their citicens/clients.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-1984' />
When a user enters in the WeTube network, s/he is ussually attached to a moderator which only censors things which are not relevant to the theme s/he is attached to. For example, one moderator can specialize only on providing news, throwing out the rest. Another moderator could provide a good collection of music of a specific style. There could be also more general moderators which only accepts everything which is legal in his/her country. And there could be another interesting type of moderator which accept content which is censored in his/her country, but that content is globally considered good in the rest of the world, making him/herself an activist pro human rights against dictatorships.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-2304' />
A user of WeTube allways can choose whose moderators s/he wants. He is presented with a default, which is usually a group of moderators which keeps things legal. But s/he can allways choose to exit that moderation, or combine with others. Yes, multiple moderators are allowed, but interesting enough, the system allows also to be attached only to &ldquo;unmoderated&rdquo; (moderators themselves enter in this mode to pick good staff througout filtering).</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-3597' />
Anyone can be a moderator and no personal information is required. Just register a nick and go to the moderation area, and there you got it.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-2211' />
Now it is time to introduce the concept of WeTube entry points:</div>
<h3 class="subsection_"><a id='magicparlabel-2219' />
The entrance to the world of WeTube</h3>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-2225' />
The p2p programs are a problem in themselves. They require the user to install an application in their computers and configure things. The learning curve is also ussually high, and passing links to another person is complicate because requires both sides to have the program installed and configured. Another important problem is that those programs are not really real-time, so the user must wait for the entire media to download in order to start watching it, which is extremely slow and inconvenient.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-2506' />
So we propose a very nice solution: WeTube can run in your browser and in your mobile device, so you can pass links around, use a nice interface, embed videos in your blogs, send by email, and do with the content all the things you can actually do with with any page.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-2560' />
But, because WeTube is in fact a p2p protocol, with thousands of servers and users connected to it and making it run, the web is only one of the possible interfaces. As a protocol, it can run on webpages, but also in the form of applications which uses the WeTube libraries to present themselves in other convinient forms. Desktop applications and mobile applications are perfectly posible.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-2697' />
The average user will use a simple web interface as his/her entry point. Many WeTube servers will also provide an entry point that will download the JavaScript program that runs in the browser, which is in fact the interface for WeTube. Optionaly, every entry point to WeTube can choose their default moderators, and even disallow the users to select moderators which provide illegal material, just to avoid legal issues. Of course, in this case, the user can change the entry point for another less restricted that allows more moderators, or simply download a full-featured browser extension with unlimited access.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-3053' />
The matter of allowing entry points to be fully moderated has many advantages:</div>

<ul class="itemize"><li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-2987' />
The site itself can avoid legal issues.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-2990' />
A site that is meant to provide content for just one specific area, for example, news or scientifics, can filter the rest out.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-2993' />
A site with content only allowed for childs, could be considered safe and can provide only useful and educative content for them, filtering out violence or sex, and also boring things.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-3099' />
Those sites are also a way to promote WeTube itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section_"><a id='magicparlabel-3467' />
The rise of privacy</h2>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-6729' />
Privacy is a big problem today. Corporations and goverments keep track of everything yo do, and use the information they collect from you to make a profile of your personality that they then use to impose certain things and make decisions.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-6886' />
People tend to think that the information they collect from them is just for advertising purposes, but that is only a tiny part. And I will put some examples:</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-6905' />
The main target are libertarians, anarcho-socialist, anti-capitalists, anarcho-captitalists, comunists, people aware of their rights as citicens, artists, media distributors (incorrectly named &ldquo;hackers&rdquo;), protestors, open source activicts, many minorities, people protesting against goverments regulations, people protesting against monopolies, scientifics out of the status-quo, and more. In a sense: people who embrace freedom, wether they are from the left or the right.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7052' />
Wars are used as an excuse to impose vigilance and coercion against the people. Actual corporations want to earn money, yes, but the point is that, meanwhile, they are a tool to impose censorship and control. Any good company who is worried about their clients privacy is ussually forced to give all the information they gather to goverment agencies. And this is happening in most countries, some more than others.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7148' />
But we belive in freedom and self-responsability. And privacy is vital at this point, because we must protect ourselves against censorship. It doesn't matter what you have to say, what are your ideas, if you can't spare them.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7217' />
Important is also your economic privacy. Remember that most media providers requires you to give your credit card number in order to start downloading media, even if it is free media. iTunes and Google Play are examples. When you give your credit card to them, not only are you de-facto telling them who you are exactly, but you are telling banks and therefore goverment agencies what are you doing with your money. This is a very strong form of coercion to artits too, because that implies that only artits aproved by them can reach a sufficent audence to make a life.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7406' />
So we embrace Bitcoin and derivatives for the economic parts of WeTube, because it allows anonymous and non-coercible transactions.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7479' />
More importantly, we base our identity parts in Keyhotee, that has an impresive list of privacy and security features, including the posibility to register any nick in a completely distributed network, not owned by anybody, and therefore out of the information collectors. This is the only way today to obtain real private anonymous IDs.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7565' />
Of course, we also protect your IP. Even if you need an internet connection to connect to WeTube, in the very moment you enter into it, your privacy is guarantied because all data travels encripted and completely distributed. So the only thing that a man in the middle can see is that you are connected to WeTube, but cannot know what are you truly doing.</div>
<h3 class="subsection_"><a id='magicparlabel-7668' />
But what about criminals? Couldn't they have inpunity in this system?</h3>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7681' />
They can't have inpunity because this is a moderated system. Criminal activites sould be inmediatly rejected by most moderators. Illegalities could also be cut-off.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7696' />
Yes, they could still broadcast media to the unmoderated area, but that area will be mostly ignored by normal people.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7770' />
We believe that if you try to censor terrorists or psicopaths, the only thing you will obtain is a stronger response from those groups, and motivate them to use actual physical forces. Most moderators and users do understand that the best they can do is ignore criminals, or even better: create content that severely expose their badness and identities by investigations.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-7865' />
Also, we should consider that most people are actually good people and don't like violence. Most of the biggest threads to humanity did precisally came from wars and false-flag actions, of course motivated by the dark sides of goverments and bankers.</div>
<h2 class="section_"><a id='magicparlabel-3521' />
Economic incentives</h2>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-8417' />
WeTube is a Distributed Autonomous Corporation (DAC), this means that it is going to have:</div>

<ul class="itemize"><li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-8432' />
Investors (those who buy its stock).</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-8437' />
Workers, those who sell their art, maintain servers, do the programming, moderate, promote the site, etc.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-8447' />
Clients, those who contract preferencial services, pay for art, or ad space.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-8577' />
Free clients, those who benefit from the system but don't require special treatment, which are the majority. Free clients should have a satisfactory experience without having to pay nothing, like in Youtube.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-8526' />
Dividends! To be automattically paid to workers and investors.</li>
</ul>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-8534' />
But, the interesting thing is that anyone without exception can participate from this enterpreneu. Lets repeat this very loud:</div>
<h4 class="paragraph_"><a id='magicparlabel-8819' />
IN A DAC, ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY CAN PARTICIPATE, IT IS ANONYMOUS, PAYMENTS ARE FULLY AUTOMATIC, THE CORPORATION IS NOT BELONGED TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR, NOR BEING PLACED IN ANY PARTICULAR PLACE, EVER. IT IS FULLY DISTRIBUTED AND AUTOMATED.</h4>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-8821' />
You can buy shares and wait for dividends. Yo can put a server and win shares and dividens. You can be an artist and recieve payments in the form of shares and dividends. You can be a moderator and be rewarded for you hard work with shares and dividends. All will be fully automatic, nobody is going to aprove or deny you. And the more you work/invest, the more you're going to obtain. There are no human contracts to be negotiated or signed. Every worker/investor/client is free to enter or exit the system in the way and amount s/he wants. All algorithms to achieve this are very cleverly programmed. In fact, the only rules are in the software, based on mathematical facts, so everybody is treated in function of that. There is no possible violation nor human intervention in the automated process.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-9110' />
This way of constructing business is incredible! In one hand it satisfy liberartarian aproaches because it permits investment and innovations, and in the other hand it also satifies anarcho-socialists because this is a comunity of workers that get paid with justice and inviolability, maintaining their rights and aspirations. You can think of a DAC like a big autonomous cooperative of workers and investors. And everything is voluntary.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-8567' />
All payments should be in Bitcoin and/or any other important altcoin.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-9078' />
People can buy shares, so they recieve dividends. Shares of WeTube could become very valuable in the future!</div>
<h3 class="subsection_"><a id='magicparlabel-9088' />
The Workers</h3>
<h4 class="subsubsection_"><a id='magicparlabel-9592' />
Programmers - the great initial winners</h4>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-9596' />
In you have read something about economics of Bitcoins, DACs and the approach of Invictus Innovations, all of them are based in the concept of mining. This has some advantages and disavantages.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-9705' />
Advantages of mining:</div>

<ul class="itemize"><li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-9721' />
You attract a lot of investors and other people interested in your idea. You only have to see the impressive success of Protoshares and how thousands of people got involved into it the first week.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-9742' />
People worry about your project and encourage the adoption of it.</li>
</ul>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-9750' />
However, it has also serius disavantages:</div>

<ul class="itemize"><li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-9756' />
Real workers are not motivated to do any programming, so you must centralize this task and put money of your own to overcome it in the form of bounties. This is ironic, as you pursue decentralization but you obtain the contrary: centralization of human resources, at great cost.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-9870' />
Many criminals mine virtually for free, using botnets, a form of virus that steal computer power from infected computers of innocents. They obtain at least 1000 more shares this way than an individual. And solutions to end up this are not clear nor efficent.</li>
</ul>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-9986' />
It is my opinion that a DAC of this characteristics should not be driven by the greed of eventual hackers. It is also my opinion that the persons who do most of the efforts should be the initial shareholders of this company, just like it happens in the real world. Do you imagine Steve Jobs doing what he did knowing that he had only 0.0001% of the company he just created? No, he had a good share because he tooks the risks and has the ideas (it is irrelevant if after some years he sold them).</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-10111' />
So I propose something that would not like very much to speculators, but certainly will motivate programmers and serius investors to do serius work here.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-10125' />
My proposition is to centralize the capital in a group of programmers EXACTLY ONLY for the INITIAL phase of the project until we have the first alpha released to the world. I mean: the initial shares of the company are equally distributed to the programmers, only in function of the amount of code/art/documentation they write manually. We can debate how amounts are measured. And, after the release of the software, the company becomes COMPLETELY, without exception, DECENTRALIZED. This is the equivalent of the actual way in which most companies start: first it comes the idea, then comes the partners who do the initial work, and then, if the company has succeed, it goes to the stock market.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-10262' />
This way, the programmers will obtain their part with justice, their work will be rapdly rewarded once the system if fully functional, in the form of dividends. And because they obtain a good part of it, this project should become very primordial in their minds. They should be very motivated to maintain the source code in the future because they have a proper share that they don't want to drop in value.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-10397' />
Compare this with a programmer who has been paid a simple bounty. S/he would have no further motivation to maintain it.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-10524' />
My proposition is to form a democratic virtual cooperative of programmers in which everybody who contributes can share her/his ideas, with the compromise to obtain their shares one day before the launch and then become investors. After that moment, WeTube DAC will be maintained by its workers (artists, moderators, clients and servers), but the programmers will still have the important role and motivation of maintaining the software itself.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-10789' />
Because I know that there are people who want to invest but don't have any skills to contribute, we can also create a ProtoMediaShares, similar to what Protoshares is, that could be converted to WeTube DAC's shares at the launch, at some proportion. We are open to this proposition if we still give programmers something like 3/4 of the total initial shares. But some shares could be given to miners-only with a moral condition: please promote WeTube!</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-11267' />
Our intention to develop this initial political system is precisely to encourage the initial decentralization of human resources, which are the most valuable of them all, and without them we can only fail and give power to people who don't really want to get involved but just get rich without having to do nothing. Think about this question: would you give shares of your company to someone who steals money from someone else? He will steal from you when he find the proper moment, too.</div>

After the initial share partition upon programmers (and probably some miners that act as promoters), people can invest in the usual ways for WeTube: by serving, by uploading content, by moderating, or just by buying shares in the Bitshares market.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-11539' />
How do we know when to do the partition for the programmers and become fully decentralized? Very simple: when we start to operate and recieve the first clients, so we are forced to become a BitAsset and operate on Bitshares market. This comes exactly at the same time that the first alfa release happens, the same time at wich the original block of our blockchain is released. From there on, WeTube DAC is fully decentralized an it is on its own. :)</div>

And what part of the stock do we reserve for programmers and miners? I propose 10% for programmers and 2.5% for miners. The 87.5% left is reserved for workers to be earn slowly once the system starts running. 10% is really a lot if we consider that this DAC could become the next Youtube. Imagine you do about 10% of the programming, that would give you 1% of the total shares that WeTube will ever have, which would convert you in a millionare in some years.</div>
